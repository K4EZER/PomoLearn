It helps students and learners manage focus time and breaks using the Pomodoro Technique — all **offline** and distraction-free.

What is the Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time-management method that:
1. Breaks work into focused intervals (commonly 25 minutes)
2. Follows each interval with a short break
3. Helps reduce burnout and improve concentration
